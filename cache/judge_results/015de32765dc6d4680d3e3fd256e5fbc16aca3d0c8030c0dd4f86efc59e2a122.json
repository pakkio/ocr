Result B, while containing nulls and empty arrays, at least provides a structured schema for potential dashboard elements (dashboard_title, charts, metrics, time_series, text_content, watermarks). This schema, even if currently empty, is infinitely more useful than an entirely empty object. It sets up expectations for what kind of data *could* be extracted and provides a framework for future improvements or for a different image. An empty object gives no information or structure.",
